		<header>
			<div class="grid">
				<h1>A Golden Demonstration</h1>
				<h2>
					Try resizing your browser or viewing this page on different devices. Use the icon in the upper right corner to see an overlay of the grid. It works by folding your screen sizes in half. Just like DIN paper sizes.
				</h2>
			</div>

		<article id="twoway" class="left">
			<section class="grid">
				<h3>A two-way split</h3>
				<p>
				These two blocks of text will float side by side with some empty columns on the sides on large screens. On medium-sized screens the empty columns will disappear, and on small screens the blocks will be stacked vertically.
				</p>

			</section>
			<section class="grid">
				<h3>By the way</h3>
				<p>
					If you're viewing this page on an iOS device, it might zoom in wonkily when you rotate your device. This is because of <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/examples/iosScaleBug/">a Mobile Safari bug</a>.
				</p>

      <article id="fourway" class="left">
			<section class="grid">
				<h3>And if you are like me...</h3>
				<p>
				You simply need more options for sizing your columns. Because just dividing by two won't cut it. Which brings us to my four-way splits.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="grid">
				<h3>A four-way split</h3>
				<p>
					These 4 columns here will hold up splited on all screen sizes except the iPad mini and phone sizes. The whole folding in half idea means you can keep a golden ratio to all your columns sizes.
				</p>
			</section>
            <section class="grid">
				<h3>Which means</h3>
				<p>
				You can actually count on designing your site once and not worrying about display. Thus every folding will result in half the number of columns available.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="grid">
				<h3>But why?</h3>
				<p>
				The maximum layout width is based on 16 columns, only visible on big screens. Laptops will most likely use 8 columns, while phone and tablets will use only 4 columns at a time. Get it?
